KiT-RT - The kinetic transport solver for radiation therapy
===========================================================

The KiT-RT framework is a powerful open source platform for radiation transport. Its main focus is on radiotherapy planning in cancer treatment. To allow problem-specific method selection, the framework provides different deterministic solver types. This not only facilitates treatment planning, but also provides tools to investigate various research questions in the field of radiative transfer. This goal is supported by an easily extensible code structure that allows straightforward implementation of additional methods and techniques.

The software is being developed by members of the group `CSMM <https://www.scc.kit.edu/forschung/13971.php?tab=%5B14114%5D#tabpanel-14114>`_ at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). For more information, please contact any of our authors (link to authors page).
